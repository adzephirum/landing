# landing

This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN/hub/easybank-landing-page-SU1NIhltr) I wanted to try for fun. I edited the landing page I made as an exercise at Le Wagon Bootcamp to make this responsive landing page.

I basically wanted to brush up a bit some CSS stuff such as Flexbox, CSS Grid and CSS variables.

I used that [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoQ6S1a32j8) from [Coder Coder](https://coder-coder.com/) when I was stuck.

Here is the [result](https://dmdgarcia.github.io/landing/).
